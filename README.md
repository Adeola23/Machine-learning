# Machine-learning
The project aims to train a logistic regression model and LSTM to predict the sentiments of tweets about coronavirus.EDA was done first and from that we can see that march was month of most tweet with  more than 12000 tweets, there were more postive tweets in total , the top unigram is 'the', top bigrams are 'to,the', top trigram are'the, grocery, store'
Preprocessing the data can be considered as the most important part of using prediction models. The gathered tweets both test and train must be cleaned before being predicted by the model. As a result, the data is cleaned by removing @ tags ,  URL , # tag,  all non-character,  extra space. Also, all tweets have been lower-cased in the pre-processing stage . The removal makes logistic regression algorithm to work fast and quite correct.  Then tokenized to separate each word in the sentence and lemmatized , a new column called corpus was created to store the  cleaned tweet . before training the logistic regression removed stop words and  created a vectorizer to transfrom both x_train and x_val as this leads to this leads to a few problems mainly with common words like “a”,”the”,”and”,”an” afterwards the logistic regression is trained and produced a cross val score of 0.79. I order to get a better  result gridsearch was employed to identify the best params for the logistic regression. a bidirectional lstm is used here , we need to feed the LSTM model a sequence of words and every sequence must have the same length there we must pad those sequences.Needed to compile the model before training it. This means specifying some parameters of the model which produced an accuracy of 0.87 on test data
